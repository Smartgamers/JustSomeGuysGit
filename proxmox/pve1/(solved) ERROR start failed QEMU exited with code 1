my second VM didnt work because of a problem with my cpu.
for some reason the cpu i was usin (Intel(R) Core(TM) i3 CPU M 330) was being seen wrong.
somehow the default option for that cpu seems to be messed up, opther people using the same cpu have encoutered the same problem.
but switching to (kvm64) or (host) seems to have solved it ◝(ᵔᵕᵔ)◜
