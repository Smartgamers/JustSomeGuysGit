so when trying to apt update with root i get error 401 unathorized ip.
looking uo 401 we see that it probably means something about lacking premission.
so i decide to try and update vie proxmox admin webpage instead of ssh command line
it spits out a error cuz i dont have the premium subscription,
but then it works fine anyways ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧

I ran into this problem again a second time, so a new fix was discoverd!
Solving this was done in the (Reposotorys) page under (Updates)
You will have some enterprise packages on by default and not just one, but multiple with diffrent names
just disabeling them and enabeling the free counter parts sovse this error.
