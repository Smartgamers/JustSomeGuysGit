thsi was my first VM on Proxmox
problem one was that after getting the VM up and running, i loaded into the graphical install.
But something seemed wrong. it was really ugl, and in some parts unreadeble,
this was because my allocated RAM was 512 so it booted into (low memory setup mode)

After finnaly logging in to my machine i encountered another error.
i could not ping 8.8.8.8 why? i dont know.💀💀💀

After all this i decided to switch to Ubuntuserver 24.4 instead because i am familiar with it
unlike Debian witch i used have used not very much. (..◜ᴗ◝..)
