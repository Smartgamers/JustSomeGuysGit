Specs hp rmn hstnn-fo1c(4cpuslow) (4gbramslow) (1thddext4mid)

This is my first Proxmox server ever. iwill be following the Proxde from (Learn Linux TV) on youtube.


After enabeling virtualisation and downloading the iso to my internal drive. i got it working, i just needed to connect it to my home made network swithc and it was done

i will probably be using this as a backup node in a cluster. yknow, to migrate vms when moving my main server. If i expand my proxmox setup.
